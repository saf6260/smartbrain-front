Hello and thank you for visiting! This is the repository for the front end of a website completed as a final project for one of the online classes I took in the summer of 2018. The website performs
face recognition on uploaded images. The repository for the back end of this app can be found at https://github.com/saf6260/smartbrain. The face recognition for the app is done thru clarifia, a facial recognition API for images. The website itself is hosted at https://smart-brain-saf.herokuapp.com/ via Heroku for both the front end and the back end.

To see all of the other stuff I learned and worked on while learning web development, please visit https://github.com/saf6260/web_development

Thanks again for visiting and I hope you enjoy the project I completed.

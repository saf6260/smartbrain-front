Hello and thank you for visitng! This is the repository for the front end of a website completed as a final project
for one of the online classes I took in the summer of 2018. The website preforms  
face recognition on uploaded images. The repository for the backend of this app can be found at 
https://github.com/saf6260/smartbrain. 
The face recognition for the app is done thru clarifia, a facial recognition api in images. 
The website itself is hosted at https://smart-brain-saf.herokuapp.com/ via Heroku for both the front end and
the back end.

To see all of the other stuff I learned and worked on while learning web development, please visit

Thanks again for visiting and I hope you enjoy the project I completed.

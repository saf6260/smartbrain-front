Hello and thank you for visitng! This is the repository for the front end of an app I call smart brain that does 
face recognition in uploaded images. The repository for the backend of this app can be found at 
https://github.com/saf6260/smartbrain. 
The face recognition for the app is done thru clarifia, a facial recognition api in images. 
The website itself is hosted at https://smart-brain-saf.herokuapp.com/ via Heroku for both the front end and
the backend.
